Note:	
Intro with "problem": Watching professionals play their respective sports,
entertainers do a show or just talking to a community of likeminded people
has always been a staple of the entertainment industry.
But this company has been bringing this type of content to another level:
By doing it live, interacting with your communities has never bee easier.

Note:
Twitch.tv is a platform where anyone can stream their content live,
to an audience of millions of viewers on their own channel. What you
stream depends solely on your own imagination, from games, to
cooking, to lectures, to just chatting with your viewers, to huge
events. All whilst being able to interact with your community in realtime.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/business.jpg" -->
Note:
FIRSTLY: The company behind twitch is Twitch Interactive Inc,
a private corporation.
But, since amazon acquired the platform in august of 2014 it acts as
a subsidiary of amazon. That means, twitch is still its own legal
entity (to separate taxes, liability etc,) but is in every
other aspect controlled by the parent company.

<h2 style="color:#8205b4;margin-bottom:-20px">The internal structure</h2>
<img src="resources/structure.png" style="border:5px solid black;">
Note:
Even though they are part of amazon, there naturally still is an
internal structure.
As is common for private companies, twitch is lead by a board of officers.
Here you can see a general overview of the
hierarchy, though this is slightly outdated because the CEO just
announced, that he would be stepping down in the near future.

Note:
Twitch is software engineering company. So, they are almost exclusively
active in the tertiary, or even quartery economic sector. Aside from their
main business, which is developing new features for their platform and
maintaining it, they also produce merchandise and organise events, which
could in part be categorized into the secondary sector.

Note:
Twitch was originally launched as justin.tv in 2007. Back then the company
behind the platform was called Justin.tv Incorporated, Seeing most
of their growth in the gaming categories, they decided to bring it into
its own platform in 2011, resulting in the birth of twitch.tv.

<img src="resources/esports.jpg">
Note:
Becoming the largest platform in the streaming-niche, they had around 100
employess in late 2013. By February of 2014 they were the 4th largest source of
internet traffic in the US with 43 Million viewers vsiting the platform every
month to watch esports events, speedruns or just to spend time with teir
favourite streamer.

<img src="resources/amazon.jpg">
Note:
The amazon deal in 2014 didnt change much of the inner workings, aside from
amazon adding their own COO to the team.<br>
Integrating with amazon payments and amazon prime, twitch started to
offer new possibilites for viewers to support streamers in the coming years.
They also saw growth in non-gaming categories, expanding their target group.

<!-- .slide: data-background-iframe="https://twitchtracker.com/statistics" data-background-transition="slide" -->
Note:
Its hard to get exact numbers, but nowadays twitch employs between between
1000 and 5000 people. Boosted by the pandemic in 2020, twitch now holds an
unrivaled spot next to youtube as one of <b>the</b> online platforms for entertainment.
And as you can see here, the platform still manages to attract more and more viewers.

<!--<video data-autoplay src="resources/shortxqc.mp4" muted></video>-->
Note:
All in all, I think that the platform deserves its standing in the industry.
IRL Events such as twitchcon (a yearly convention where streamers and viewers meet)
are highlights for all participants. I personally enjoy spending time in some of
these communities alot. It just adds so much to the viewing experience to be able
to chat with other viewers in parallel or just to see their reactions.
