## Here are my stored notes, presentations etc.
I am using (atm. still developing) a workflow, where you just write plain markdown (parsed by [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)) that automatically gets published as reveal.js presentations on my website.

The dream would be, to be able to inject LaTeX for Math stuff and to build nice pdfs from these slides. I plan to use the notes function of the reveal for that, so that you can get presentations that are slick and lean but still have extensive scripts at the end of the day.

One great thing about the external markdown stuff that can be loaded into reveal is, that you can just switch to inline html at any moment. This includes using extern css and much more, creating endless possibilities to create ***actual nice looking notes*** that dont have cryptic source-code, bust just markdown or at the worst html (which, to be frank, is just plain-text with some fancy decorators and tags).
